Advent Of Code 2021

This is my attempt att learning Common Lisp (having previous experience with Scheme), so far it's been mostly "learn the loop macro"...

Some "rules" I made up along the way:

* No external libraries, just the standard library
* Don't fix ugly/buggy code once the right answer is produced, show it "Warts and all"

In particular the code for part 1 of day 10 is wrong! it produces the right answer "by accident".
